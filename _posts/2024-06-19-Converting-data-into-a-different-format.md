GitHub Copilot can efficiently convert data between various formats, making it a powerful tool for developers working with exported data from design tools. Jesse Swart demonstrates a simple three-step process to transform structured data like SQL statements into other formats such as Markdown.<!--excerpt_end-->

The method involves: (1) exporting data from a table designer tool into a textual format, (2) referencing your target format in your IDE, and (3) asking Copilot to convert the data with a simple prompt. This approach saves time and reduces errors when manually converting complex data structures, making it especially valuable for creating test files or documentation from exported design artifacts.
