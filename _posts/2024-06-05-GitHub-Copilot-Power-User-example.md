Rob Bos demonstrates a real-world GitHub Copilot workflow by walking through a complete code refactoring task. The example shows how he extracted a script from a YAML pipeline (GitHub Actions) into a separate file using Copilot's assistance.<!--excerpt_end-->

The post documents Rob's actual prompts and the corresponding results, providing transparent insight into his process. Importantly, he also highlights where Copilot initially failed to provide a complete solution and shows how he used follow-up questions to achieve his desired outcome. This honest look at both the strengths and limitations of AI pair programming makes this tutorial particularly valuable for developers looking to improve their own Copilot workflows.
