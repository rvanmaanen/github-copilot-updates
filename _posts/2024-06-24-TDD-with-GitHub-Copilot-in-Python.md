In this article, Jesse Swart shares his experience with attempting test-driven development (TDD) in Python for the first time, leveraging GitHub Copilot as an assistant. <!--excerpt_end--> Drawing on his previous experience with both Python and personal finance application development, Jesse wanted to see how Copilot could help streamline the TDD process. He recalls selecting a personal finance administration system as a project, which he had already conceptualized due to past exposure. The article serves as an introduction to exploring AI-powered development tools' impact on TDD workflows, particularly for developers both familiar and new to the methodology and Python.
