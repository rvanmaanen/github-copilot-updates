Over the past months I've delivered 100s of GitHub Copilot workshops. Ranging from 2 hour introduction talks, where I quickly walk through the main features of the product, up to day-long workshops with interactive hands-on.

For most people it's pretty easy to get started. In Visual Studio Code you install a plugin, in Visual Studio 2022 it's installed by default, but in other IDEs it can be a bit trickier to get GitHub Copilot to work.

In my experience the different Jetbrains IDEs are among the trickiest. This includes IntelliJ, Rider, Pycharm, Webstorm, RubyMine and more. So far I've found two main problems that break GitHub Copilot.
