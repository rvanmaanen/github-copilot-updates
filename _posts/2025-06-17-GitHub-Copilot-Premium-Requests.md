In this article, Rob Bos delves into the recently introduced Premium Requests system for GitHub Copilot, highlighting how the changes will directly impact developers, organizations, and end-users. <!--excerpt_end--> With this enforcement, users will now be charged for their consumption of Generative AI in Copilot beyond the basic quota included in their chosen plan, making transparency about resource use — and its real monetary cost — a central theme.

## What Are Copilot Premium Requests?
Premium Requests are incurred whenever a user interacts with a non-default LLM model (such as GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, or GPT-4.5) within GitHub Copilot. Different models have different multipliers: a request sent to some advanced models (like GPT-4.5) can cost up to 50x more than a standard one, while others (like Gemini 2.0 Flash) may be much cheaper at 0.25x. Premium Requests are consumed in a variety of scenarios:

- **Conversational interactions:** Each question/answer turn with a non-default model.
- **Coding Agent steps:** Every step the Copilot Coding Agent takes counts as one request, with multi-step processes consuming even more.
- **Code reviews, pull requests, and agent mode usage in editors:** Each such feature invocation uses at least one Premium Request.

Extensions and Copilot Spaces also consume Premium Requests, though precise details remain undocumented.

## Pricing and Plan Details
Copilot plans (Free, Pro, Pro+, Business, Enterprise) differ in the number of monthly included Premium Requests. If the quota is exceeded, extra charges apply (e.g., {{CONTENT}}.04/request). The true cost can spiral quickly when high-multiplier models are used; for instance, a single GPT-4.5 request at 50x multiplier costs $2.00.

Breakdown:
- Copilot Free: 50/month
- Copilot Pro: 300/month
- Copilot Pro+: 1500/month
- Copilot Business: 300/user/month
- Copilot Enterprise: 1000/user/month

## Managing Spend and Usage
Users and organizations can now set a monthly spending cap (default {{CONTENT}}.00) to block Premium Requests upon reaching the limit. Progress tracking is visible within major IDEs (VSCode, JetBrains, Visual Studio) via dedicated UI elements, helping devs monitor consumption in real time.

## Reporting and Analysis Tools
To assist organizations, Rob Bos introduces a self-hosted, open source SPA (Single Page Application) that visualizes usage from the official GitHub Copilot Premium Requests CSV export. This can be found on GitHub and helps enterprise admins analyze usage patterns and detect overspending risks.

## Summary
This transition from an all-inclusive to a pay-as-you-go model for advanced Copilot features is designed to foster a more responsible approach to usage and budget management amongst both individual devs and organizations. Developers are now encouraged to consider the cost implications of choosing different AI models and managing premium request allocation for their teams.
