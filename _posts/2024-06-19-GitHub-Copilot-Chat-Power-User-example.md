Rob Bos demonstrates advanced GitHub Copilot Chat techniques by walking through the process of creating a script to interact with the GitHub API. In this practical tutorial, he shows how to get the most value from the AI pair programmer when tackling complex tasks.<!--excerpt_end-->

The video highlights Rob's actual prompts and results, showing both initial attempts and refined approaches. A key insight is how spending more time crafting a detailed initial prompt significantly improves the quality of Copilot's response. The example covers creating a script that calls the GitHub API in a loop, processes input from a file, summarizes results based on the responses, and calculates both per-item and overall averages - demonstrating how Copilot Chat can handle multi-faceted programming tasks.
