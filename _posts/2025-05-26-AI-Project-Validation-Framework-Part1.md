Before investing significant resources into AI development, it's crucial to determine whether AI is genuinely the most effective solution for your business problem. Hidde de Smet's comprehensive framework provides a structured decision tree to evaluate AI projects.<!--excerpt_end--> This is done through strategic alignment, business impact, feasibility, and ROI assessment, helping organizations make informed decisions about when to pursue AI initiatives and when to consider alternatives.

The framework breaks down the validation process into five key levels:

1. **Strategic alignment** - Does the AI project align with company objectives?
2. **Potential business impact** - What primary benefit (cost reduction, revenue increase, risk mitigation, etc.) will the project deliver?
3. **Impact quantification** - Can you estimate the potential value with reasonable accuracy?
4. **Feasibility & effort** - Do you have the necessary data, skills, and technology?
5. **ROI assessment** - Does the quantified impact justify the estimated effort/cost?

For a detailed explanation of this decision framework and practical guidance on implementing it, check out [the full article on Hidde de Smet's website](https://hiddedesmet.com/ai-project-validation-framework-part1). This is part 1 of a 3-part series that will also cover practical examples, ethical considerations, success metrics, and pilot project implementation.
